## Regular Expressions

Find regexes that match the following. (e.g. find a single regex that matches
both `antelope` and `antelopes`.)
Answer ======> antelopes?.+

-   Single regex that matches either of these:

    antelope rocks out

    antelopes rock out

-   Regex that matches either of:
    Answer ======> [^b]oat/g
    goat

    moat

but not:

    boat

-   Regex that matches dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Year can be 1-4 digits, and
    month and day can each be 1-2 digits). This does not need to verify the date
    is correct (e.g 3333-33-33 can match).

    Answer ======> \d{1,4}+[- ]+[\d]{1,2}+[- ]+[\d]{1,2}+/g

## State Machines

> A useful tool for drawing state machines is [Evan's FSM
> Designer](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/).

-   Draw a state machine that corresponds to the following regex:

        ab*c+d?[ef]

    Remember the ε transition can be used to move between states without
    consuming input.

-   A lion can be sleeping, eating, hunting, or preening. Draw a state
    machine diagram for the lion and label the transition events that
    cause state transitions.

-   The VT-100 terminal (console) outputs text to the screen as it
    receives it over the wire. One exception is that when it receives an
    ESC character (ASCII 27), it goes into a special mode where it looks
    for commands to change its behavior. For example:

            ESC[12;45f

        moves the cursor to line 12, column 45.

            ESC[1m

        changes the font to bold.

        -   Come up with regexes for the two above sequences. The one to set the
            cursor position should accept any digits for the row and column. The
            bold sequence need only accept `1` (and is a trivial regex). (ESC is
            a single character which can be represented with `\e` in the regex.)

    Answer => ESC[\d+[;]_\d_[f,m]

        -   Draw a state machine diagram for a VT-100 that can consume regular
            character sequences as well as the two above ESC sequences.
